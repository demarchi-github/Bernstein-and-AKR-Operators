# Bernstein-and-AKR-Operators
Matlab codes for computing with Bernstein and Aldaz-Kouchev-Render Operators
on intervals, tensor-products domain, and the unitary right triangle.
In particular, AKR_SimplexD.m allows approximating with AKR operators 
plotting the corresponding surfaces and errors only on the reference triangle.
